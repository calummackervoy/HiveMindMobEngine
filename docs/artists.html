      <h2>Essentials</h2>
      <h3>Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        All graphics are 2D or "2.5D", meaning that the rotation of the camera is fixed (but the zoom is not)
        in an <b>isometric</b> perspective. The purpose of this is to give a 3D appearance to 2D art assets using
        all the techniques known to every artist- without the expensive techniques of 3D.
      </p>
      <p>
        In isometric perspective the tiles which make up the ground of the world are square, rotated at 30
        degrees to create a diamond shape, where the width of the tile is exactly twice the size of the height.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing in this perspective is simple: my preferred method is to first draw a horizontal line for the centre
        of the tile, 2cm in length, and then draw another horizontally at 4cm in length, then join the points:
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Tile in isometric perspective"/>
    </div>
    <div id="art-character">
      <h2>Characters</h2>
      <h3>Body</h3>
      <p>
        The scale of the character will vary character-to-character, but in the current version of the game all
        characters must occupy one and only one tile. Characters should be drawn so that the head, torso and leg
        components are all one-third of the total height, for the characters I've drawn all components are 3cm tall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bodies should be drawn naked (clothes are added over the top) and without a head (also drawn over the top) as shown below:
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Example character body"/>
      <p>
        All character <b>sprites</b> (for all animations) must be drawn in two positions: one facing south-west (or south-east) and one
        facing north-east (or north-west).. the other two directions of travel are covered in code by simply inverting the sprite.
      </p>
      <h3>Body Animation</h3>
      <p>
        There is a limited variety of animations in the game currently, and all need to have sprites provided for
        a character to work. Currently animations (a series of sprites) need to be provided for:
        <ul>
          <li>Walking empty-handed</li>
          <li>Running empty-handed</li>
        </ul>
        In future versions more animations will be added, and so the graphics will need to be updated.
      </p>
      <h3>Emotions</h3>
      <p>
        One head sprite should be provided viewing the back of the head, and another should be provided facing
        forwards for each of the following emotions:
        <ul>
          <li>Neutral</li>
          <li>Friendly</li>
          <li>Love</li>
          <li>Anxious</li>
          <li>Suspicious</li>
          <li>Terrified</li>
          <li>Irate</li>
          <li>Hostile</li>
          <li>Beserk (Murderous rage)</li>
        </ul>
        In future versions more emotions will be added (e.g. laughing), and so the graphics will need to be updated.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Example emotion sprites"/>
      <h3>Clothes</h3>
      <p>
        Clothing sprites for tops and bottoms should be provided separately, and each item of clothing should have one sprite
        for every body sprite it is fitted for.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Example body clothes sprites"/>
      <h3>Hair &amp; Hats</h3>
      <p>
        Head variations should have one sprite for every emotion.
      </p>
      <img src="" alt="Example head variations sprites"/>
    </div>
    <div id="art-building">
      <h2>Buildings &amp; Large Props</h2>
      <p>
        All buildings in the environment, and props larger than 1 tile in size, can be drawn as a whole if this
        is your preference, but must be split into tile-sized assets for use in the game. This is to get a greater
        variety with less memory: buildings and props can be built out of multiple tile-sized components to make the
        whole, rather than storing large and slightly-different versions of the same style of building.
